## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles


### What I learned

For making a good user-friendly application an appropriate code design is must to avoid bugs.
Before jumping to code directly, one must sketch out the code design.



### Continued development

I aim at learning advanced React.js and building better user-friendly single page applications.
